## Steps

After every code change, run the bundler and verify that the extension works as expected and run `npm test` and `npm test:mutation`.
If some tests are failing always try to fix them. If you are not able to fix them, ask me for help and never remove them or try to oversimplify them before telling me what they are testing and why you would want to remove/oversimplify them.

Do not create .md files to tell me what you did unless I ask you to.
